## Fix these first
Everything here is critical or high. The gate will not open until they are resolved.
**CRITICAL** · `.env:1` · `APW-DEP-01`

.env is present and not in .gitignore, so its values are in source control. Remove it from git, ignore it, and rotate every value it contains.

<sub>Environment files are never committed — found by cambriks-deployment</sub>

**CRITICAL** · `src/config.js:8` · `APW-SEC-01`

A credential is assigned a string literal in source. Control APW-SEC-01 requires all secrets to come from the environment at runtime.

<sub>Credentials are never committed to source control — found by semgrep</sub>

**CRITICAL** · `src/config.js:9` · `APW-SEC-01`

A credential is assigned a string literal in source. Control APW-SEC-01 requires all secrets to come from the environment at runtime.

<sub>Credentials are never committed to source control — found by semgrep</sub>

**CRITICAL** · `src/config.js:11` · `APW-SEC-01`

slack-webhook-url has detected secret for file src/config.js.

<sub>Credentials are never committed to source control — found by gitleaks</sub>

**CRITICAL** · `src/config.js:14` · `APW-SEC-01`

aws-access-token has detected secret for file src/config.js.

<sub>Credentials are never committed to source control — found by gitleaks</sub>

**CRITICAL** · `src/config.js:15` · `APW-SEC-01`

generic-api-key has detected secret for file src/config.js.

<sub>Credentials are never committed to source control — found by gitleaks, semgrep</sub>

**CRITICAL** · `src/db.js:28` · `APW-STD-2.4`

Clause 2.4 — Plaintext password literal is inserted into the users table, violating the requirement to store only salted hashes. Fix: Hash the password before inserting, e.g., const hash = bcrypt.hashSync('welcome123', saltRounds); then use .run('operator1', hash, 'operator');

<sub>standard-2.4 — found by cambriks-llm</sub>

**CRITICAL** · `src/db.js:30` · `APW-STD-2.4`

Clause 2.4 — Plaintext password literal is inserted into the users table for the supervisor account. Fix: Hash the password before inserting, e.g., const hash = bcrypt.hashSync('welcome123', saltRounds); then use .run('supervisor', hash, 'supervisor');

<sub>standard-2.4 — found by cambriks-llm</sub>

**CRITICAL** · `src/db.js:47` · `APW-SEC-02`

SQL statement built by string concatenation. Control APW-SEC-02 requires parameterised queries for every database call.

<sub>Database queries are parameterised — found by semgrep</sub>

**CRITICAL** · `src/db.js:62` · `APW-STD-2.4`

Clause 2.4 — User lookup compares the supplied password directly against the stored plaintext password, violating the hashed‑password rule. Fix: Select the user by username only, then verify the password with a constant‑time hash comparison (e.g., bcrypt.compareSync(password, user.password)).

<sub>standard-2.4 — found by cambriks-llm</sub>

**CRITICAL** · `src/middleware/requireAuth.js:11` · `APW-STD-2.5`

Clause 2.5 — The session parser decodes the base64 token without verifying any signature, allowing tampered tokens to be accepted. Fix: After decoding, split out the signature, recompute the HMAC with the secret, and compare it securely before trusting the payload.

<sub>standard-2.5 — found by cambriks-llm</sub>

**CRITICAL** · `src/routes/admin.js:10` · `APW-SEC-03`

Express route is registered with a handler and no authentication middleware. Control APW-SEC-03 requires every route outside the public allowlist to pass through requireAuth.

<sub>Every non-public route enforces authentication server-side — found by semgrep</sub>

**CRITICAL** · `src/routes/admin.js:14` · `APW-SEC-03`

Express route is registered with a handler and no authentication middleware. Control APW-SEC-03 requires every route outside the public allowlist to pass through requireAuth.

<sub>Every non-public route enforces authentication server-side — found by semgrep</sub>

**CRITICAL** · `src/routes/admin.js:19` · `APW-SEC-03`

Express route is registered with a handler and no authentication middleware. Control APW-SEC-03 requires every route outside the public allowlist to pass through requireAuth.

<sub>Every non-public route enforces authentication server-side — found by semgrep</sub>

**CRITICAL** · `src/routes/admin.js:23` · `APW-SEC-03`

Express route is registered with a handler and no authentication middleware. Control APW-SEC-03 requires every route outside the public allowlist to pass through requireAuth.

<sub>Every non-public route enforces authentication server-side — found by semgrep</sub>

**CRITICAL** · `src/routes/auth.js:12` · `APW-STD-2.5`

Clause 2.5 — The session token is created by merely base64‑encoding the username and role, which provides no cryptographic signature and can be forged by a client. Fix: Generate the token using an HMAC (or a signing library) over the payload and include the signature, e.g., `const payload = `${user.username}|${user.role}`; const sig = crypto.createHmac('sha256', config.secret).update(payload).digest('hex'); const token = Buffer.from(`${payload}|${sig}`).toString('base64');`

<sub>standard-2.5 — found by cambriks-llm</sub>

**HIGH** · `public/js/app.js:2` · `APW-SEC-05`

An authorisation decision is made from client-controlled storage. Control APW-SEC-05 requires authorisation to be enforced server-side.

<sub>Authorisation decisions are not taken from client-controlled state — found by semgrep</sub>

**HIGH** · `src/db.js:27` · `APW-SEC-07`

A user account is seeded with a literal password. Seeded credentials are shared, well known, and usually survive into production.

<sub>Accounts are never seeded with a literal password — found by semgrep</sub>

**HIGH** · `src/db.js:29` · `APW-SEC-07`

A user account is seeded with a literal password. Seeded credentials are shared, well known, and usually survive into production.

<sub>Accounts are never seeded with a literal password — found by semgrep</sub>

**HIGH** · `src/routes/admin.js:14` · `APW-STD-3.2`

Clause 3.2 — Bulk export endpoint does not record an audit entry naming the user, operation, and number of records exported. Fix: Add an audit log before sending the response, e.g., const records = listAll(); insertAudit(req.user.username, 'export', records.length); res.json({ exportedAt: new Date().toISOString(), records });

<sub>standard-3.2 — found by cambriks-llm</sub>

**HIGH** · `src/routes/admin.js:20` · `APW-STD-3.1`

Clause 3.1 — Route handler directly constructs and executes a SQL query using db.prepare(...).all(), bypassing the data access module. Fix: Replace the direct db.prepare call with an exported function from db.js, e.g., `listUsers()`.

<sub>standard-3.1 — found by cambriks-llm</sub>

**HIGH** · `src/routes/admin.js:23` · `APW-STD-3.2`

Clause 3.2 — Destructive purge endpoint does not record an audit entry naming the user, operation, and number of rows deleted. Fix: Capture the result of the DELETE and log it, e.g., const result = db.prepare('DELETE FROM downtime WHERE logged_at < ?').run(before); insertAudit(req.user.username, 'purge', result.changes); res.json({ ok: true });

<sub>standard-3.2 — found by cambriks-llm</sub>

**HIGH** · `src/routes/admin.js:25` · `APW-STD-3.1`

Clause 3.1 — Route handler directly constructs and executes a SQL DELETE query using db.prepare(...).run(), bypassing the data access module. Fix: Replace the direct db.prepare call with an exported function from db.js, e.g., `purgeDowntime(before)`.

<sub>standard-3.1 — found by cambriks-llm</sub>

**HIGH** · `src/server.js:26` · `APW-DEP-03`

No Express error-handling middleware. Unhandled errors return a stack trace to the client. Add app.use((err, req, res, next) => ...) after the routes.

<sub>Unhandled errors do not reach the client — found by cambriks-deployment</sub>

**HIGH** · `src/server.js:32` · `APW-DEP-05`

A credential value is written to the log. Anyone with log access has the secret. Remove the statement.

<sub>Credentials are never written to logs — found by cambriks-deployment</sub>

## Everything else
### `public/js/app.js`
**MEDIUM** · line 7 · `APW-SEC-04`

Data is written to innerHTML without escaping. Control APW-SEC-04 requires DOM text to be set with textContent.

<sub>Untrusted data is not written to the DOM as HTML — found by semgrep</sub>

### `src/routes/logs.js`
**MEDIUM** · line 11 · `APW-STD-4.1`

Clause 4.1 — The handler accepts a machine identifier via query parameter but does not validate it against the XXX‑NN pattern before using it. Fix: Add validation of req.query.machine (e.g., if (!/^[A-Z]{3}-\d{2}$/.test(req.query.machine)) return res.status(400).json({error: 'Invalid machine identifier'});) before calling findByMachine.

<sub>standard-4.1 — found by cambriks-llm</sub>

**MEDIUM** · line 15 · `APW-STD-4.1`

Clause 4.1 — The handler accepts a machine identifier in the request body but does not validate it against the XXX‑NN pattern before inserting the log. Fix: Validate req.body.machine (e.g., if (!/^[A-Z]{3}-\d{2}$/.test(req.body.machine)) return res.status(400).json({error: 'Invalid machine identifier'});) before calling insertLog.

<sub>standard-4.1 — found by cambriks-llm</sub>

**MEDIUM** · line 15 · `APW-STD-4.2`

Clause 4.2 — The handler for POST /logs accepts a 'minutes' field but does not validate that it is a positive integer ≤ 480 before writing to the database. Fix: Add a validation check for req.body.minutes (e.g., if (!Number.isInteger(minutes) || minutes <= 0 || minutes > 480) return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid minutes' })); before calling insertLog.

<sub>standard-4.2 — found by cambriks-llm</sub>

### `src/server.js`
**MEDIUM** · line 11 · `APW-DEP-02`

No health or readiness endpoint. Orchestrators and load balancers cannot tell whether this process is serving. Add GET /health.

<sub>Services expose a health endpoint — found by cambriks-deployment</sub>

### `public/js/app.js`
